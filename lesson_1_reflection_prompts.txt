How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Executing diff command: "diff -u newfile.txt oldfile.txt"

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Dropbox, Google Docs

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You know the reason of the changes

    It's very useful because you can track the changes of all files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    With git log you can see the different commits, and with git diff the
    differences between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Taking back older versions and check where the bug was introduced
